# The C2D2 Project
This is the website for hosting code and data in the submitted paper, "Modeling Challenge Covariances and Design Dependency for Efficient Attacks on Strong PUFs".

For now it contains the following items:

- MATLAB codes for simulating and attacking XOR Arbiter PUFs, using PC-enhanced LAD Model I and II;
- Sample CRP data collected from hardware experiments. The bistable ring (BR)-PUFs are implemented on Xilinx Zynq-7000 FPGA (28 nm process technology).
- User manual for PFGA experiments and simulation.

More will be added and available.

Questions regarding codes, data, algorithms, please send emails to (anonymous during paper review)
