# The C2D2 Project
This is the website for hosting code and data in the submitted DAC'22 paper,"Modeling Challenge Covariances and Design Dependency for Efficient Attacks on Strong PUFs".

Authors: to remain anonymous during paper review.

For now it contains the following items:

- MATLAB codes for simulating and attacking XOR Arbiter PUFs, using PC-enhanced LAD Model I and II;
- Sample CRP data collected from hardware experiments. The bistable ring (BR)-PUFs are implemented on Xilinx Zynq-7000 FPGA (28 nm process technology).
- User manual for PFGA experiments and simulation.

More will be added and available.
