# The C2D2 Project
This is the website for hosting code and data in the submitted paper, "Modeling Challenge Covariances and Design Dependency for Efficient Attacks on Strong PUFs".

For now it contains the following items:

- MATLAB codes for simulating and attacking XOR Arbiter PUFs, using PC-enhanced LAD Model I and II;
- Sample CRP data collected from hardware experiments. The bistable ring (BR)-PUFs are implemented on Xilinx Zynq-7000 FPGA (28 nm process technology).
- Python and MATLAB codes for performing experiments comparing with the ECP-TRN method from the following paper,
        P. Santikellur and R. S. Chakraborty, "A Computationally Efficient Tensor Regression Network-Based Modeling Attack on XOR Arbiter PUF and Its Variants," in *IEEE         Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems*, vol. 40, no. 6, pp. 1197-1206, June 2021.

- User manual for PFGA experiments and simulation.

More will be added and available.

Questions regarding codes, data, algorithms, please send emails to authors of the paper.
